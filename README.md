*Created by Logan Lee for Greenleaf Cleaning.*

Built on the chi router, aiming for simplicity in a complex system.

This will be a web application for Greenleaf Cleaning (my company I am creating) to create and manage bookings, display the services we offer, and to connect with our sub contractors via apis I will build them to their own sites. 


More documentation to come.
