This file is where I will put things that need to get got and be fixed tf up

~ routes {
	1)  Look into using https://github.com/go-chi/cors package to control requests and http headers.
		Maybe this is how to force https instead of http.
}

~ database package {
	1)  Rather than checking if the username is "", why not just have the client send
		if they are logged in or not?

	2)  If some contact information exists but does not match. Something could be better about this for sure.

	3)  Same as 2 but with address information

	4)  Am I hashing the password at the proper time?

	5)  Remove interface and replace it with int

	6)  Create logic to insert user into group

	7)  Create contact_requests table, as well as contact_requests_completed
}


~ models {
	1)  Redesign all models to match database tables
	2)  Create methods for payment struct for payment processing
}

~ utils  {
	1 - Remove fmt, no need to print to terminal.
}
