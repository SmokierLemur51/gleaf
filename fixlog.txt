This file is where I will put things that need to get got and be fixed tf up


~ database package {
	1)  Rather than checking if the username is "", why not just have the client send
		if they are logged in or not?

	2)  If some contact information exists but does not match. Something could be better about this for sure.

	3)  Same as 2 but with address information

	4)  Am I hashing the password at the proper time?

	5)  Remove interface and replace it with int
}


~ models {
	1)  Redesign all models to match database tables
	2)  Create methods for payment struct for payment processing
}

~ utils  {
	1 - Remove fmt, no need to print to terminal.
}
